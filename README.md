Concept:
In space, you are faced off against an empire of a species of aliens trying to overtake your world. You, as the guardian of earth (guardians if two player) have to protect the planet using your spaceship(s).

The overlay is rectangular portrait mode, with the dimensions somewhat thin. Players face north with the spaceships pointing up while the aliens reign down from space facing south.
	We are approaching the aliens, however, faster than they approach the planet. Assuming the spaceship is flying towards the aliens, the screen should always be moving upward, meaning in the ambience, stars or planets should be passing by downwards. But the spaceship is static relative to the screen, meaning it can only move within the vicinity of the screen. The spaceship can move using up, down, left, right. There should be no momentum or acceleration: only a constant speed for agility.
	Each spaceship is equipped with a gatling gun, fired using some other buttons than the AWSD (and other set of keys for the second player). Hold down the button for continuous firing, and there is no reloading or limits on bullets.
	There is no level selection, just one continuous battle which increase in difficulty over time. Spikes in difficulty come when aliens show up in waves, but the waves aren’t distinct. Essentially, similar to Plants versus Zombies, aliens descend continuously, but when there aren’t waves, aliens still descend just in a more sparsely populated pattern.
	 Spaceships should gain power-ups over time to complement the increasing difficulty.
	Aliens also fire at you, and there are different classes of aliens that distinguish themselves as tanky ones versus dangerous ones.

	Background should be mostly dark with some decorations like stars or faint galaxies or planets or asteroids in the background. This design/jpeg should go on a because the level might continue for a long time. The game should extend up to 10 minutes, with the last wave the hardest.


Player lives – 3
	This counter decreases if the spaceship is hit with an enemy projectile or collides with an enemy.
	The spaceship gains 3 seconds of invincibility after it loses a life.
	The lives counter should display on the bottom left corner for player one. In the case of multiplayer, player two should be on the bottom left.
	The counter should not be in numbers but hearts; there should be three red hearts on the bottom corners for each player at the start of the game.

Hotkeys – WASD and Arrows(Up,down,left,right)
	To fire, player one uses F, and player two uses M
	The spaceships should move relatively fast, faster than the aliens for sure. Within the span of 1 second, the player should be able to move from the left border to the right border of the screen.
	The firing rate, at first, shouldn’t be that great – 2 bullets/second.

Enemies – enemy spaceships
	There are 5 stages to the game, the end of each stage characterized by a wave of enemy spaceships.
	All Spaceships should move forward at the base speed of screen length/ 15 seconds.
	Three types of alien spaceships:
		Regular pawns – don’t fire. Base health – 3
		Big, meaty dudes – fire rate 1 bullet/  10 second. Base health – 9
    	Should be bigger than the average enemy
    Offensive, fast speedy bois – fire rate 1 bullet/ 4 second. Base health – 2
    	MOVES LEFT AND RIGHT – Base movement speed – screen width/10 seconds
      Should move 25% faster than the base speed vertically.
      Size should be same as regular pawns
    Green upgrade carriers – don’t fire. Base health – 5
    	Moves Left and Right – Base movement speed – screen width/10 seconds
      When Killed, grant +1  firing rate to all ally spaceships. For example, if firing rate is 3 bullets/second, the new firing rate is 4 bullets/second after killing one of these for both spaceships.

Please adjust the number of spaceships need fit to make the game difficult cause I have no idea what would make it hard or easy.
If the mode is multiplayer, increase the number of spaceships by two-fold.
Spaceships does not need to be spawned in formations or visual patterns.

The game lasts 10 minutes and should be divided into 5 stages, the end of each stage with a wave.
Each wave should at least have one green bois.
Each wave should become exponentially harder
After each wave, the base health of all enemies should increase by 1
